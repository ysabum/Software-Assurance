# Requirements for Software Security Engineering

## Hypothetical Operation Environment
Our hypothetical operation environment is for a national retail bank, where the company is developing a secure online banking application that allows customers to manage their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, and apply for loans. The company expects to integrate a security tool like Bitwarden to protect credentials and sensitive financial operations for both the employees and customers.

## Essential Interactions
1. User Logon to Account
2. User Accesses and Retrieves Secret from Secrets Manager
3. Emergency Contact Access

## 3. Emergency Contact Access
The Emergency Access feature allows a vault owner to designate trusted contacts with either View or Takeover privileges. When a trusted contact requests access, the owner can approve or deny the request within the waiting period. If approved or if the waiting period expires, the trusted contact receives the level of access that was predefined by the owner during setup. This ensures recovery is possible while maintaining owner control and security.
