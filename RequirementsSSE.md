# Requirements for Software Security Engineering

## Hypothetical Operation Environment
Our hypothetical operation environment is for a national retail bank, where the company is developing a secure online banking application that allows customers to manage their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, and apply for loans. The company expects to integrate a security tool like Bitwarden to protect credentials and sensitive financial operations for both the employees and customers.
