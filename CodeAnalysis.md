# Code Analysis for Software Security Engineering
## Code Review Strategy
Our team decided to conduct our code review using a scenario-based approach using the use cases [we developed previously](https://github.com/ysabum/Software-Assurance/blob/main/RequirementsSSE.md). We identified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) relevant to our indivudal uses cases, then as a group, we decided as a team which CWEs to prioritize for manual review of Bitwarden's code. Automated review using code review tools seen below was then done as a team, where we decided what CWEs closely aligned with the results of automated review. The results were then compared to the CWEs from manual review.

(What challenges did you expect before starting the code review? How did your code review strategy attempt to address the anticipated challenges?)
