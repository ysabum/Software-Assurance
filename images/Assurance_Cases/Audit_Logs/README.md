# Bitwarden Audit Log Assurance Case
![image](https://github.com/ysabum/Software-Assurance/blob/main/images/Assurance_Cases/Audit_logs/Assurance_case.drawio.png?raw=true)

## **Top Claim (C1):**
**Bitwarden audit logs minimize tampering and unauthorized alteration.**

---

## **Context**
Bitwarden is an open-source password manager that records critical user and system actions.  
The audit log subsystem helps ensure accountability by detecting unauthorized or unexpected modifications to user data and system configuration.

---

## **Justification**
This assurance case argues that Bitwarden maintains trustworthy audit logs by ensuring **integrity**, **availability**, and **restricted access**.  
Security mechanisms such as **cryptographic signing**, **replication**, **backup enforcement**, and **role-based access control** collectively ensure that audit logs cannot be modified or deleted without detection.

---

## **Subclaims and Argumentation**

### **C2: Audit logs maintain integrity through cryptographic signing.**
- **Rebuttal (R1):** Unless signing keys are exposed or signing is disabled.  
- **Sub-Claim (C3):** Signing keys are securely stored and verified before each log signature operation.  
- **Rebuttal (R2):** Unless key storage is misconfigured or verification fails.  
- **Evidence:** [Bitwarden Signed Log Configuration and Key Protection Documentation (E1)](#e1-bitwarden-signed-log-configuration-and-key-protection-documentation)

---

### **C4: Logs are immutably stored and replicated across trusted servers.**
- **Rebuttal (R3):** Unless audit log replication fails.  
- **Sub-Claim (C5):** Replication mechanisms ensure logs remain synchronized, verified, and recoverable even if one server fails.  
- **Rebuttal (R4):** Unless replication logs are corrupted.  
- **Evidence:** [Bitwarden Replication Documentation and Immutable Storage Configuration (E2)](#e2-bitwarden-replication-documentation-and-immutable-storage-configuration)

---

### **C6: Log retention and backups are enforced.**
- **Rebuttal (R5):** Unless audit log backups are incomplete.  
- **Evidence:** [Backup Restore Logs (E3)](#e3-backup-restore-logs)

---

### **C7: Log access is restricted to authorized administrators.**
- **Rebuttal (R6):** Unless admin roles are overly broad.  
- **Evidence:** [Admin Activity Logs and Access Control Lists (E4)](#e4-admin-activity-logs-and-access-control-lists)

---

## **Evidence**

### **E1: Bitwarden Signed Log Configuration and Key Protection Documentation**
**Link:** [https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/](https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/)  
**Description:**  
Bitwarden signs logs with secure cryptographic keys to ensure log entries cannot be altered without detection.  
Keys are stored securely and verified before each signing operation.  
**Gap:** Key rotation and lifecycle management details are not explicitly described.

---

### **E2: Bitwarden Replication Documentation and Immutable Storage Configuration**
**Link:** [https://bitwarden.com/help/data-storage/](https://bitwarden.com/help/data-storage/)  
**Description:**  
Bitwarden stores logs on redundant, cloud-based infrastructure to prevent data loss.  
Replication ensures log copies are synchronized and recoverable in case of server failure.  
**Gap:** No documentation on external integrity verification for replication logs.

---

### **E3: Backup Restore Logs**
**Link:** [https://bitwarden.com/help/export-your-data/](https://bitwarden.com/help/export-your-data/)  
**Description:**  
Bitwarden retains and restores backups to maintain log availability.  
Backup restore logs verify that all log data can be recovered accurately.  
**Gap:** Backup frequency and retention duration are not clearly defined in public documentation.

---

### **E4: Admin Activity Logs and Access Control Lists**
**Link:** [https://bitwarden.com/help/user-types-access-control/](https://bitwarden.com/help/user-types-access-control/)  
**Description:**  
Only administrators with defined roles can access or review audit logs.  
Access permissions are controlled using role-based access control (RBAC).  
**Gap:** Role review automation is not currently documented; permissions may need periodic manual review.

---

## **Alignment and Gaps Summary**

| **Integrity** | Logs are digitally signed and verified using secure keys. | Key rotation policy not detailed. |
| **Availability** | Logs are replicated across servers with backups. | No external replication verification. |
| **Access Control** | Restricted admin-only access to audit logs. | Manual role reviews; lack of automation. |
| **Backup & Retention** | Backup logs ensure long-term data recovery. | Retention period not publicly stated. |

**Overall Assessment:**  
Bitwarden’s audit logging mechanisms provide strong protection against tampering and unauthorized alteration.  
Minor assurance gaps remain in key lifecycle documentation, replication verification, and access control automation.  
These can be mitigated by enterprise configurations or policy enforcement.

---

## **Reflection**
This assurance case demonstrates how Bitwarden ensures audit log trustworthiness through multiple defensive layers.  
The process of mapping subclaims and rebuttals clarified how **cryptographic integrity**, **replication**, **backup enforcement**, and **access control** together support the top claim.  
It also highlighted improvement areas, such as automating role reviews and external verification of replication integrity.

By connecting real documentation links as evidence, this assurance case moves beyond theory — showing clear proof of Bitwarden’s reliability and transparency.

## **Reflection**
Working on this assurance case helped me understand how Bitwarden keeps its audit logs safe from tampering or deletion.  
By breaking the system into smaller parts like signing, replication, backups, and admin access, I learned how each layer protects the logs in a different way.  
It also showed me that having evidence and documentation is important to prove that the system really works the way it should.  
Overall, this project helped me connect what I learned in class to a real open-source tool and made me more confident in analyzing system security.
