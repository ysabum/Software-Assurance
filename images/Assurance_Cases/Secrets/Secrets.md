Documentation for Bitwarden's Encryption Protocols can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/what-encryption-is-used/). This documentation describes the encryption protocols used by Bitwarden to encrypt secrets; the protocols include AES-256-CBC and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. These protocols are chosen to provide strong encryption and to be compatible with the latest standards. All vault data (including secrets) is encrypted by Bitwarden before being stored anywhere. Bitwarden provides a backup option to encrypt the secrets before uploading them to the cloud.
