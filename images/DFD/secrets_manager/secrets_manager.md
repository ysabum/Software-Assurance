### Mitigations Confirmed in OSS Implementation

1. **Bitwarden's Encryption Protocols:** Documentation for Bitwarden's Encryption Protocols can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/what-encryption-is-used/). This documentation describes the encryption protocols used by Bitwarden to encrypt secrets; the protocols include AES-256-CBC and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. These protocols are chosen to provide strong encryption and to be compatible with the latest standards. All vault data (including secrets) is strongly encrypted by Bitwarden before being stored anywhere. Bitwarden provides a backup option to encrypt the secrets before uploading them to the cloud.

2. **Bitwarden's User Type Access Controls:** Documentation for Bitwarden's User Type Access Controls can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/managing-users/) and [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/user-types-access-control/). This documentation describes the different user types and their access controls in Bitwarden. Bitwarden provides four main user types: user, admin, owner, and custom. Whether a member can access the Secrets Manager depends on their user type and their access controls. 

3. **Bitwarden's Event Logs Documentation:** Documentation for Bitwarden's Event Logs can be found [here](https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/). This documentation describes the different types of events that are logged in Bitwarden, including login/logout, secret creation, and vault access. The event logs can be used to track user activity and identify unusual activity.  

### Identified Gaps and Areas for Improvement

After comparing the DFD-based threat analysis with Bitwarden’s official documentation, we identified the following key gaps:
