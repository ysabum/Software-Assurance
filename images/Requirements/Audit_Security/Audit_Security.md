# Audit Security – Use Case 1

## Description of the Use Case
The Bank Security Team uses Bitwarden to keep track of important activities.  
Here’s how it works:
1. Bitwarden creates logs for logins, secret retrievals, and secret rotations.  
2. The Security Team opens the Bitwarden Admin Console.  
3. They check the logs and enforce rules like requiring MFA, blocking certain IPs, or stopping copy/export of data.  
4. If they find something unusual, they take action such as revoking access or rotating secrets.  

This helps the bank monitor user actions and react quickly to any security issues.

## Misuse Cases
A malicious ex-developer might try to misuse the system in these ways:
- **Delete or change logs** → stopped by **immutable server-side log storage**.  
- **Read logs to steal metadata** (like usernames or IPs) → reduced by **role-based admin permissions**.  
- **Use a stolen account to bypass policies** → blocked by **mandatory MFA and policy enforcement**.  
- **Flood the system with fake log entries** → detected by **alerting and anomaly detection** tools.  

---

## Security Requirements
To stay secure, the system needs:
- Logs that cannot be changed or deleted.  
- Admin permissions so only the right people can see or use logs.  
- Mandatory MFA and policy rules that even stolen accounts can’t bypass.  
- Alerts and detection for strange behavior like log flooding.  
- Quick ways to revoke accounts and rotate secrets when needed.

## What Bitwarden Provides
Bitwarden already offers many helpful features:
- **Audit logs & event monitoring** (enterprise accounts).  
- **Zero-knowledge encryption** so only users can see their secrets.  
- **Policy enforcement** like MFA, IP restrictions, password rules, and export controls.  
- **Role-based access** to control what admins can see.  
- **Revocation tools** to remove access and rotate secrets fast.  

Some advanced features (like stronger anomaly detection or full immutable storage) may need external tools or enterprise versions.

## OSS Project Documentation: Security-Related Configuration and Installation Issues

Bitwarden provides strong documentation for its enterprise features, including audit logs and event monitoring:  
 https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/

However, some configuration and installation issues in the OSS version do not fully align with the documentation. For example:

- **Audit Log Availability Limitations:**  
  Bitwarden OSS clients do not include enterprise-grade event logs. The documentation often assumes organizational accounts, but OSS users will not see the same level of audit detail. https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/

- **Delay in Client-to-Server Log Sync:**  
  As noted in the official docs, server events are captured immediately, but client events are only synced every 60 seconds. This delay is not always clearly emphasized, which may lead to confusion when testing near real-time monitoring.
  https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/#client-events

- **Immutable Log Storage Not Native:**  
  While the docs discuss audit logs, OSS installs do not provide built-in immutability or WORM (Write Once, Read Many) protections. Administrators must configure external log management systems (e.g., Splunk, or SIEM tools) to achieve tamper-proof storage. https://bitwarden.com/help/event-logs/

- **Role-Based Permissions Scope:**  
  Role-based access is explained well in the documentation, but OSS versions provide only limited granularity compared to the enterprise edition. This mismatch can create gaps if teams rely solely on OSS for fine-grained log visibility.

## Reflection
This assignment helped me realize that even simple features like audit logs can be attacked in different ways. By looking at how a malicious ex-developer might try to misuse the system, I saw why features like MFA, permissions, and secure logs are so important.It also showed me how Bitwarden’s documentation connects with these ideas and how real-world tools provide protection. Overall, I learned to think not only about how a system should work, but also how it could be misused.
